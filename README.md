This is a virtual exhibition by Tiana Wang.
It was designed and written by Jack Adam (https://jackadam.cc/)

The exhibition opened on May 1, 2020, amid the COVID-19 outbreak in the US, and at the end of a remotely-conducted spring semester. At a time when our peers and colleagues were spread across the globe, and the digital capacity of our university was stretched, the exhibition proposal was threefold:

1.  The exhibition will be globalized. It will change with the sun, and viewers across the globe will experience its content according to the time of day.</span>

2.  The exhibition will be customizable.  As to how content is experienced, several choices will be presented without hierarchy.</span>

3.  The exhibition will not (only) be an exhibition.  It will be a living catalogue, a tool for sorting media, a testament to the times, and a chance to come together, albeit virtually.</span>

One day, the enclosed artifacts and memories of traveling will not seem so distant a reality. Maybe then, the Ezra Stiles Art Gallery will be able to reopen its rickety doors! For now, it is my pleasure to present Tiana Wang: Lifescapes in Time.
